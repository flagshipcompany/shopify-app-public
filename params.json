Instantly upload data, print labels, process shipments, share real-time rates or set shipping rates on your online store - and more!  Manage shipments for online purchases easily and take your Shopify store to the next level with Flagship.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n* Get real-time discounted shipping rates from Flagship's online shipping system to your Shopify store.\r\n* Print your labels from the app.\r\n* Manage pickups from the app.\r\n* Split the shipment in several boxes depending on weight.\r\n* Push any order to Flagship's online shipping system to create a prequoted shipment (useful if you don't have realtime quoting available in your Shopify Plan).\r\n* Easy way of adding residential surcharges to the quoted price.\r\n\r\n##Considerations\r\n * Only \"Unlimited\" Shopify plans will benefit from real time quoting. Shops with a lesser plan will still be able to offer standard and/or flat rate shipping to their online store and send shipment information to Flagship's online shipping system through the Flagship for Shopify App.\r\n * Since Shopify does not provide dimensions of your store goods, the shipping rate is made by weight only. Make sure you enter the dimensional weight for your goods if necessary for large but light items.\r\n\r\n## Connecting the app to the Flagship API\r\n\r\nWhen the app is installed, you will be taken to this page where you register your token to the app.\r\n\r\n![Token Register Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/token_register.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Create Token Credentials\r\nGo to https://auth.smartship.io, **login with your Flagship credentials** and create a set of credentials using the Shopify Preset\r\n\r\n*NOTE: Only Flagship Account Managers can access the credentials page*\r\n\r\n![Auth Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/auth.png)\r\n\r\n**copy** or keep this page open, as we will need some information from this `token` that was created.\r\n\r\n### Register your access token\r\n\r\nInsert the **Active token** text from the token that we just created into the **Access token** field.\r\n\r\n![inputs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/token_key_inputs.png)\r\n\r\nSubmit the keys by pressing the **Save token credentials** button. If the key pair is valid, you will have successfully linked your app to the Flagship API.\r\n\r\nYou now have full access to the Flagship for Shopify app.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason, your token gets deleted, you will be redirected to this page if you ever access the app, as your token does not exist and is not considered valid. You will need to create a new token if you wish to continue using the app.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started With the Flagship for Shopify app\r\nHere are the menu options that can be done in the app\r\n\r\n![Main Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/main_menu.png)\r\n\r\n* **Pending Orders**\r\nAllows you to complete orders using Flagship's online shipping system and dispatch them.\r\n* **Prepared Orders**\r\nAllows you to view dispatched shipments, request documents and view the shipment overview (done on the Flagship online shipping system).\r\n* **Pickups**\r\nAllows you to schedule pickups for dispatched shipments, view pickups and cancel scheduled pickups.\r\n* **Settings**\r\nChange app settings that modify quoting and shipment options when dispatching using Flagship's online shipping system.\r\n\r\n### Flagship for Shopify App Settings\r\n\r\n* **Services**\r\nCheckboxes consisting of the courier services that Flagship offers, and a list of the various services types that the couriers will offer. You can use these checkboxes to show or hide certain couriers or services so that they will not appear in the *shipping method* menu at checkout.\r\n\r\n* **Packaging**\r\nAllows you to set a weight limit split on individual boxes in orders, meaning that if you have an order which would exceed the weight that you provided, the app adds an extra box during the quoting and dispatch processes.\r\n\r\n* **Additional Services**\r\nAllows you to set options for orders to be automatically fulfilled in your Shopify admin page when you dispatch an order through the Flagship for Shopify app. **Note** this feature only applies to stores that use live courier rates which can automatically dispatch orders from the Flagship for Shopify app.\r\n\r\n* **Additional Charges**\r\nAllows you to add a residential surcharge during the quoting process and dispatch process. This helps get more accurate rates during the quoting process and the dispatch process. You can also choose to insure orders that are made through your store with Flagship's discounted insurance program.\r\n\r\n### Pending Orders\r\n\r\nThis is the page where you can see all the orders that have been placed by customers. \r\n\r\n![Pending Orders](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/pending_orders.png)\r\nThis page also allows you to take orders and convert them to a shipment using the Flagship online shipping system. You can also automatically dispatch orders from this page as well, provided the order was quoted with a Flagship service.\r\n\r\nUpon installing the app, it will fetch all the orders your store has not marked as shipped from the past thirty days and add them to the app's records so that you can start using the Flagship for Shopify app right away.\r\n\r\n* **Order Number**\r\nThe order number as it appears in your Shopify admin store. Links to the overview for the order in your Shopify admin page.\r\n\r\n* **Order Date**\r\nThe date the order was placed on.\r\n\r\n* **Courier Used**\r\nThe courier used or the company who provides the shipping service (ex: UPS, FedEx, Purolator, etc.).\r\n\r\n* **Service Used**\r\nThe shipping service selected by the customer.\r\n\r\n* **Quoted Price**\r\nThe price that was displayed to the customer at the shipping method page in your storefront.\r\n\r\n* **Is Fufilled**\r\nChecks to see if the order has been fufilled in your admin page. An order is considered fufilled by the app when you mark the order as having been fully paid in your Shopify admin page.\r\n\r\n#### Actions\r\nAn action that can be taken for the order, usually in the form of a button or a link. Different factors will determine what will be shown and what actions it will take.\r\n  \r\n* **Convert order on Flagship**\r\n![Convert Order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/convert_order.png)\r\nAny online store order that was processed via the Flagship for Shopify App using a standard or flat rate must be sent to the Flagship online shipping system to select your choice of service, courier rate and to complete your shipment. \r\n**Note**: you will not be charged for completing this action on the Flagship for Shopify App. However, when you complete your order and dispatch it through the Flagship online shipping system, you will be charged for this order.\r\n\r\n* **Dispatch Order to Flagship**\r\n![Dispatch Order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/dispatch_order.png)\r\nAny online store order that was processed via the Flagship for Shopify App using live courier rates can be immediately dispatched to the Flagship online shipping system by pressing the **Dispatch Order to Flagship** button. This will automatically create the necessary documents you need to send the shipment to your customer, such as the shipping labels and the commercial invoices, if necessary. If your order has been fulfilled in your store's admin page, a prompt will appear asking you to confirm the dispatch. This extra step is for your benefit and ensures you do not dispatch an order that has already been sent out **or** so you do not get charged for an order that you do not plan on shipping.\r\n**Note**: By dispatching an order using the Flagship for Shopify App, you will be charged for the dispatched order on the Flagship online shipping system.\r\n\r\n* **View on Flagship**\r\n![View On Flagship](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/view_on_flagship.png)\r\nAllows you to either see the overview for your order or continue the quoting process on the Flagship online shipping system. If your order was prequoted using the app, the link will bring you to the quote page for your order on the Flagship online shipping system. If the order was dispatched using the app, then the link will be the same, but will instead take you to the shipment overview page for the order on the Flagship online shipping system.\r\n\r\n### Prepared Orders\r\nThis allows you to see all the orders you have dispatched using the Flagship for Shopify app and online system.\r\n![Shipments Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flagshipcompany/shopify-app-public/master/img/shipments.png)\r\n\r\n* **Order Number**\r\nThe order number as it appears in your Shopify admin store.

Every dispatched shipment will link to a regular sized label and a thermal label. A label must be placed on each of the packages in your shipment. For international shipments, there is a commercial invoice document that must also be included in the shipment along with the shipping labels. All the documents are in .PDF format.\r\n\r\n* **View On Flagship**\r\nBrings you to the overview page for the shipment on the Flagship online shipping system.\r\n\r\n###Pickups\r\nThis link will bring you to the pickup actions page.

This is your store's address information.\r\n\r\n* **Pickup Date**\r\nThe date when you want to schedule the pickup.
